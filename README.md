The development of quantum mechanics has been phenomenal since the beginning of the
20th century. But over time physicists realised that the standard Hermitian framework
originally fomalised by Paul Dirac is inadequate and not inclusive toward non-Hermitian
operators. Although it has been shown, through rigorous mathematical and well-founded
physical principles, that non-Hermitian operators often have a real spectrum.

This dissertation tries to outline the major developments in the field of non-Hermitian
quantum mechanics. In Chapter 1 we explore PT symmetry, which was initially success-
ful in explaining and justifying the consequences of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians that are
invariant under the application of parity-time operator. Later in the chapter, a symmetry
operator C, similar to the charge conjugation operator in particle physics, is introduced
to complete the theory of PT-symmetric quantum mechanics.

Chapter 2 introduces pseudo-Hermiticity, which subsumes PT-symmetric theory,
and establishes a more general framework. Pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics is the
natural approach in understanding non-Hermitian systems. We briefly touch upon quasi-
Hermitian operator theory, an important early development in the field. And finally, end
with our conclusions and remarks.
